# Computer-vision-tasks
This repository is a compilation of image processing tasks performed by me during the Computer Vision course. 

## Basic Image Processing

**Usage:**    
The IPython notebook "Basic_Image_Processing.ipynb" can be run on Colab. Please upload all the image files from [this](https://github.com/Vinit-source/Computer-vision-tasks/tree/main/Basic%20Image%20Processing) folder before running.

**Tasks:** [Link](https://github.com/Vinit-source/Computer-vision-tasks/blob/main/Basic%20Image%20Processing/Questions.pdf)    
**Code:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vinit-source/Computer-vision-tasks/blob/main/Basic%20Image%20Processing/Basic_Image_Processing.ipynb)    
**Report:** [Link](https://github.com/Vinit-source/Computer-vision-tasks/blob/main/Basic%20Image%20Processing/Report.pdf)    
Refer [here](https://github.com/Vinit-source/Computer-vision-tasks/blob/main/Basic%20Image%20Processing/DWT_Example_slides.pdf) for demo of Discrete Wavelet Tansforms.

## Advanced Image Processing

**Usage:**    
- The IPython notebook "Advanced_Image_Processing.ipynb" can be run both on local system or on Google Colab. Please make sure to convert the flag `COLAB` as True before running it on Colab.
- The outputs for the local runtime would be stored in 'outputs' directory.
- For Colab, please upload 'common.zip' from my submission.
Question 4 might take very long to run on local.
