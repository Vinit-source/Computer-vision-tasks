This repository is a compilation of image processing tasks performed by me during the Computer Vision course.

*Usage:*
The IPython notebook "Basic_Image_Processing.ipynb" can be run on Colab. Please upload all the image files in [this]() folder before running.

## Advanced Image Processing

*Usage:*
The IPython notebook 'Advanced_Image_Processing.ipynb' can be run both on local system or on Google Colab. Please make sure to convert the flag `COLAB` as True before running it on Colab.
The outputs for the local runtime would be stored in 'outputs' directory.
For Colab, please upload 'common.zip' from my submission.
Question 4 might take very long to run on local.
